# NTC Implementation Blueprint - Security Tooling

This repository is part of the **Nuvibit Terraform Collection (NTC) Implementation Blueprints** - a comprehensive reference implementation showcasing best practices for building enterprise-grade AWS platforms using NTC building blocks.


## 🎯 Overview

The NTC Implementation Blueprints provide a complete, production-ready example of how to structure and deploy AWS infrastructure using the [Nuvibit Terraform Collection](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-library/). These blueprints are deployed in a dedicated customer-simulated AWS organization (`aws-c2-*`), demonstrating real-world multi-account architecture patterns and configurations.

### Key Characteristics

- **Best Practice Architecture**: Implements the [Nuvibit AWS Reference Architecture (NARA)](https://docs.nuvibit.com/whitepapers/nuvibit-aws-reference-architecture/) with battle-tested patterns
- **GitOps Workflow**: All infrastructure is managed through Git with automated CI/CD pipelines
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure, short-lived credentials
- **Modular Design**: Each repository manages a specific domain or AWS account
- **Production-Ready**: Demonstrates configurations suitable for enterprise deployments

## 📋 Purpose of This Repository

This repository (`aws-c2-security`) manages the **Security Account** and is responsible for:

- **Centralized Security Monitoring**: Organization-wide security visibility through AWS Security Hub
- **Threat Detection**: GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection across accounts
- **Vulnerability Management**: Inspector for automated vulnerability scanning
- **Configuration Compliance**: AWS Config for resource compliance monitoring
- **Access Analysis**: IAM Access Analyzer for identifying resource sharing risks
- **Security Automation**: Automated finding enrichment, processing, and notifications
- **Compliance Reporting**: Centralized security reporting and metrics

### NTC Building Blocks Used

This repository leverages the following NTC building blocks:

- [**NTC Security Tooling**](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/security/ntc-security-tooling/) - Centralized security monitoring and compliance
- [**NTC Parameters**](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/management/ntc-parameters/) - Cross-account parameter sharing and orchestration

**Building Blocks**: [NTC Core Network](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/connectivity/ntc-core-network/), [NTC VPC](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/connectivity/ntc-vpc/), [NTC IPAM](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/connectivity/ntc-ipam/), [NTC Route53](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/connectivity/ntc-route53/), [NTC Parameters](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/management/ntc-parameters/)

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

All blueprint repositories follow a consistent GitOps workflow:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All configurations are version-controlled in Git
2. **Pull Request Workflow**: Changes are proposed via pull requests
3. **Automated Planning**: CI/CD pipeline runs `terraform plan` on pull requests
4. **Peer Review**: Changes are reviewed before merging
5. **Automated Deployment**: Merging to main triggers `terraform apply` via CI/CD
6. **OIDC Authentication**: Pipelines authenticate to AWS using OpenID Connect (no static credentials)

## 📚 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **NTC Access**: Valid NTC subscription and access credentials
2. **AWS Account**: Dedicated Security account created via NTC Account Factory
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured CI/CD tool (e.g., Spacelift, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)
4. **Admin Delegations**: Security Hub and security services (GuardDuty, Inspector, Config, IAM Access Analyzer) must have admin delegations configured in AWS Organizations

:::info
Admin delegations can be easily managed via [NTC Organizations](https://docs.nuvibit.com/ntc-building-blocks/management/ntc-organizations/).

### Deployment Order

The blueprint repositories should be deployed in the following order:

1. **aws-c2-mgmt-organizations**   (foundation setup)
2. **aws-c2-mgmt-account-factory** (creates security account)
3. **aws-c2-mgmt-identity-center** (creates sso permissions)
4. **aws-c2-log-archive**          (creates audit log archive)
5. **aws-c2-security**             ← *You are here*
6. **aws-c2-connectivity**         (creates central connectivity)
